The theme Ashwath is designed keeping smartphone and iPad users in mind. A clean, minimal, app like design is more comfortable to use on a mobile browser. It looks real nice on desktop as well.  

Full version will have the following options.

1. Color Schemes
2. Pagination
3. Categories customization guide
4. Author section
